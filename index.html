				<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">I had visited in December 2018.</h5>
				<p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

				</h4>
				<hr>
				<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">I had visited in May 2020.</h5>
				<p class="text-muted text-left">One of the most authentic Chinese Restaurants in town, Nanjing keeps it simple and tasty. Situated on the top floor of CG Square Mall, the restaurant has classy interiors though it is not overtly Chinese in its décor.It also serves good Asian food and has a lot of variety. Nanjing is one of the few places in town where one can find several pork preparations. Their quantities are also big and their staff is helpful and knowledgeable about their menu. Try their Lemon and Coriander Soup or Nanjing Special Soup both of which have vegetarian and non-vegetarian versions or even the Spinach, Bean Curd, Bean Thread and Shiitake Clear soup. They have great starters. Do try Drums of Heaven, Spare Ribs, which fall off the bone or Stuffed Crab Shells. Vegetarian can try Jade Roll or Baby Corn And Mushroom. For the main course, non-vegetarians should try their Roast Pork with Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots, Kung Pao Prawns Dry or the traditional Chinese Roast Chicken. Vegetarians also have a wide spread of main courses to choose from. Try their Hidden Jewels In A Cave or Saucy Okra. Their prices are reasonable so it will not dent your pocket.</p>

				<p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

				<p>Its mythic story of life and death, not to mention a cast of lions and hyenas, The Lion King was an unlikely candidate for a photo-realistic treatment. But the new film leaps into naturalism, with dazzling authenticity as computer-generated herds of zebras, elephants and antelope stride across the screen against a wide African vista, toward Pride Rock, where King Mufasa stands waiting to hold up his cub, Simba. With The Circle of Life soaring in the background, this majestic scene draws us into the film’s enthralling world before a word is spoken. It may all be CGI, but The Lion King feels more life-like than Disney’s many recent live-action remakes of its animated classics.The opening scene echoes the start of the 1994 original almost shot for shot. It doesn’t take a detective to see why that film quickly became a classic. It has adorable animals and rivals Bambi in its moving death of a parent storyline. Elton John and Tim Rice’s original songs are so buoyant and stirring, they are now as familiar as anything from The Sound of Music.</p>

				<p>It's hard to follow up a movie like Frozen. The first film was a smash hit that undermined the tropes of fairy tale storytelling, sparking a renaissance in the (unconventional) Disney Princess business. With the beautiful, expansive, and frustrating Frozen 2, directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck attempt to add new lore, mythology, and a deeply political analogy which, despite early promise, ultimately misses the mark. It's a choice that muddies the message of Frozen 2 and also adds confusing continuity issues when it comes to the sisters and their newly uncovered past.Beginning with a flashback and then jumping straight off of where the last film ended, Frozen 2 gets off to an exhilarating start that establishes new lore and slickly sets up the core conflicts of the film. With Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) reunited and safe -- the latter now ruling over Arendelle and the former just happy in her new status quo -- things seem to be back to normal. That is until a mysterious voice begins to call to Elsa, eventually leading her to a mysterious enchanted forest. However, an early reveal about one of their parents proves a nagging continuity issue.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
